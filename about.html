That amounts to nearly five pounds per person a day. New York City collected 934 tons of metal, plastic, and glass a day from residents last year, a 33 percent increase from 2013."

    <p id="Coney"> According to the Los Angeles Times, “for most of the last decade, Avalon Harbor Beach has ranked among the most polluted in the state, tainted with human sewage that puts swimmers at risk,” and “a report last month by the [NRDC] listed Avalon as one of the 10 most chronically polluted beaches in the nation for failing state health tests as much as 73% of the time.” Researchers explain the pollution is due to the city’s sewer system, which is made of metal pipes and extremely old clay.</p>
